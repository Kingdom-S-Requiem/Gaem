Hello, and if you're reading this, chances are you are interested in this project. And if that's the case, thank you! We appreciate the interest from ya. My partner De'Antwan and I have cooked up an indie adventure style text-based game! This game follows Elisabeth, a girl who is blamed for a mass family incident she did not commit. Within the trail, she gets thrown out of the city, and is exiled because of the end result. In this, she runs to the underground caverns entrance, certain her fate is down there. After some careful thought, she goes to leave, but it blocked in by falling rocks. Left with nothing but her thoughts, she must venture down to find salvation in the darkness. 

This is a text based game, meaning options will come up available to be typed out. These options have to be typed out exactly as shown or else the game will not work. Random encounters with death AKA reality can check in, and will result in death. The player can do nothing about this except restart. There is an easter egg ending, you just have to read between the lines to find it. There are also a couple of jokes in here, like when it first prompts you to start the game or not.

Here's the flowchart of work: <img src"Gaem.jpg">height = "400" width ="400">
